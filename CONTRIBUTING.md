# Contributing

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute!
Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, be inspired, and create.
Any contributions you make will benefit everyone else and are **greatly appreciated**.

Try to create bug reports that are:

- _Reproducible._ Include steps to reproduce the issue.
- _Specific._ Include as much detail as possible: what version, what environment, etc.
- _Unique._ Do not duplicate existing open issues.
- _Scoped to a single bug._ One bug per report.
